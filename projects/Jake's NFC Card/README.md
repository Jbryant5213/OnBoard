# Hacker Card and USB Hub

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
My board is blue with my last name and the dodgers logo on it. I designed it like this so my dad can use it for his buissness and I can use it myself. My USB hub will be used
as a demonstration for other members in my Hack Club in my school.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
$25.14 for the Card, $22.12 for the USB Hub
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
